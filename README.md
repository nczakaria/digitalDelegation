# digitalDelegation
Digital usage is currently becoming more common. We can make our financial and medical decisions easily through mobile phones. Therefore, we need an online financial and medical decision platform. 
The motivation of this research is to understand what are the Prevalence and predictors of caregivers who are currently engaged as Financial and Medical Digital Proxies to another adult.
The dataset used in our study comes from a survey data study on caregiver delegation. It focuses on understanding how people help other adults in the domains of physical care, legal-financial care, and medical care, which are answered both in Singapore. 
The Research Questions are for SG, What is the prevalence of digital proxies? What factors predict the likelihood of being a digital proxy? How common are informal methods when carrying out their digital proxy duties?
Based on these research questions, we need to understand variations in human behavior as digitizing this service could potentially be influenced by culturally-driven reasons and provide insights in a call to action to empower digital proxies when caring for their vulnerable person.
From this research, we know who are the ones participating in the Digital Proxies and how they are engaging in digital proxies' methods. We can now look into the second step of seeing how we can develop policies to promote better usage of digital practices. How we can educate people better in SG to make sure financial and medical digital practices can be done in an ethical manner.
